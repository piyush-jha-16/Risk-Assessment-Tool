🛡️ Cybersecurity System Scanner

A lightweight and easy-to-use Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Tool built in Python that helps detect and analyze potential vulnerabilities in a system and network. This tool is designed for students, researchers, and beginners in cybersecurity to understand how system risks can be identified with simple checks.

🚀 Features

🔍 Open Port Scanner → Scans common ports (21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 443, 8080) to check for open/closed ports.

🌐 Connected Devices Scanner → Lists all devices connected to the same Wi-Fi/network.

📡 Network Status Check → Tests connectivity and latency (ping).

⏱️ System Uptime Monitor → Displays how long the system has been running.

💾 Disk Space Monitor → Shows available vs used disk space.

🔥 Firewall Status Check (planned) → Detect if firewall is enabled/disabled.

⚡ Internet Speed Test (optional) → Measures upload and download speeds.

🎯 Problem it Solves

Many users are unaware of hidden risks such as open ports, unauthorized devices, or misconfigured firewalls.
Existing tools are often complex, Linux-only, or require third-party installations.
This project provides a simple yet effective tool to quickly assess system and network security risks.
